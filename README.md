## Description
This project allows to create a simple lexer based on information which are obtained from grammar rules. A defined lexer can be used to process a text using lexical analysis. 
An output from the analysis is a sequence of definded tokens. The information can be used as input to a parser that processes results of the lexer. Tokens are produced from 
the lexer based on the longest match rule (match groups algorithm based on the article https://www.labs.hpe.com/techreports/2012/HPL-2012-41R1.pdf).
	
## Requirements
* programming language compiler: C++11
* build utils: Cmake

## Setup
To setup the project, use the followings commands (all dependencies are downloaded by Cmake):
```
$ cd <project_dir>
$ git clone https://github.com/krystianAndrzejewski/lexer
$ cd lexer
cmake -H. -Bbuild -G <generator_name:"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64">
```

## Usage
An example of the project usage is defined in main.cpp. A regular expression has a special syntax (is practically coherent with other regExp implementation) and can be assembled from the operators 
(all operators produces a regular expression that can be combined with other regular expression):
* <ascii_character> - a basic operator that is defined as a translation (input character must match the value of the operarator),
* [<ascii_character>-<ascii_character><ascii_character>(...)] - a multi-basic operator that is represented by one or more ascii character that must match the operator (dash operator takes two neighboring ascii characters and allows to get all characters from created range between the characters),
* [^<ascii_character>-<ascii_character><ascii_character>(...)] - a multi-basic operator that is represented by one or more ascii character that cannot match the operator (dash operator takes two neighboring ascii characters and forbids to get all characters from created range between the characters),
* ( <regular_expression> ) - a group operator that allows to combine other operators,
* <regular_expression>* - 0 or more greedy repeation of the regular expression,
* <regular_expression>+ - 1 or more greedy repeation of the regular expression,
* \<regular_expression>|\<regular_expression> - alternative operator that allow to defines two regular expresion and one of them must matched with a input.
<p>Escaped characters for a basic operator are \\, \(, \), \+, \*, \|, \[ and for a mult-basic operator are \\, \]. </p>
<p>Errors during processing either a grammar definition or a text to compilation are reported by exception or returned values. </p>
